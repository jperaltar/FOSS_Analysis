spdx_notes: >-
    Ruby is disjunctively licensed project that allows the choice of this license
    and another. The other license choice has changed over time (from GPL originally,
    to BSD-2-Clause currently), so one needs to be aware of that change. The Ruby
    License itself is un-versioned, but has varied a bit over the years, the last
    substantive variation being in 2002.
