    Per Fedora: The Trusster Open Source License (TOSL) is a derivation of the Sleepycat License. The one significant difference is that where the Sleepycat License says:

      The source code must either be included in the distribution or be
      available for no more than the cost of distribution plus a nominal
      fee, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable conditions.

    TOSL is somewhat more specific:

      The source code must either be included in the distribution or be
      available in a timely fashion for no more than the cost of
      distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely redistributable
      under reasonable and no more restrictive conditions.

    While the Sleepycat License is considered to be a free, GPL-compatible license, TOSL is GPL-incompatible because of the addition of the "no more restrictive" language.
