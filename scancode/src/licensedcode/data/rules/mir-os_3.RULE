This licence is apt for any kind of work (such as source code, fonts,
documentation, graphics, sound etc.) and the preferred terms for work
added to MirBSD. It has been drafted as universally usable equivalent
of the "historic permission notice"_ﾲ_ adapted to Europen law because
in some (droit d'auteur) countries authors cannot disclaim all {{2  liabi_
lities. }}Compliance to DFSG_ﾳ_ 1.1 is ensured, and GPLv2 compatibility
is asserted unless advertising clauses are used. The MirOS Licence is
certified to conform to OKD___ 1.0 and OSD___ 1.9, and qualifies as a
Free Software___ and also Free Documentation___ licence and is {{2 inclu_
ded }} in some relevant lists_______ﾹ__.

We believe you are not liable for work inserted which is intellectual
property of third parties, if you were not aware of the fact, act {{2  ap_
propriately }} as soon as you become aware of that problem, seek an {{2 ami_
cable }}solution for all parties, and never knowingly distribute a work
without being authorised to do so by its licensors.
